# Task_1 2017/2018-II
Task 1 : Introduction to C++

## Workflow
1. FORK and CLONE this repositori ASD_Task_1
2. open and modify codes in *.cpp files inside project ASD_Task_1
3. write your code inside the provided space in each functions/procedures (`asd_task_1.cpp`) 
4. COMMIT and PUSH  your project
5. create a Pull Request

## Exercise 1
TODO:  
* Write an algorithm which will prints all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 100 and 200 (both included)
* `procedure exercise_1()`
* Output should be: 112, 119, 126, â€¦, 196

## Exercise 2
TODO:
* Write a procedure algorithm to raise any number to any power.
* `procedure exercise_2(n, p)`
Example:
`
	integer n = 2
	integer p = 3
	exercise_2(n, p)
	Output : 8
	
	integer n = 4
	integer p = 2
	exercise_2(n, p)
	Output : 16
`

## Exercise 3
TODO:
* Write a procedure algorithm that determines the type of a Triangle (isosceles, equilateral, or scalene) given the size of the three sides
* `exercise_3(s1, s2, s3)`
Example:
`
	integer s1: 4
	integer s2 : 6
	integer s3 : 4
	exercise_3(s1, s2, s3)
	Output : isosceles
	
	integer s1: 3
	integer s2 : 3
	integer s3 : 3
	exercise_3(s1, s2, s3)
	Output : equilateral
`

## Exercise 4
TODO:
* Write a procedure algorithm to continuously receive a numerical input from user and add it into an array of integer until user inputs number 0
* `procedure exercise_4()`
* Try input: 3, 6, 2, 8, 0

## Exercise 5
TODO:
* Write a function algorithm to find a number inside an unsorted array of integer, and outputs its index; algorithm will outputs -1 if such number is not found
* function int exercise_5(arr, f)
* Array input is formatted from previous exercise, 
* value 0 indicates the end of array
Example:
`
	integer arr = {3,6,8,2,7,8,1,0,0,0,0,0}
	integer f = 2
	integer x = exercise_5(arr, f)
	Output = 3
`

## Exercise 6
TODO:
* Write a procedure algorithm to find a number inside an unsorted array of integer, then insert a negative one (-1) behind such found number
* Use previous search function
* Array input is formatted from previous exercise, 
* value 0 indicates the end of array

Example:
`
	integer arr = {3,6,8,2,7,8,1,0,0,0,0,0}
	integer x = 8
	exercise_6(arr, x)
	arr result = {3,6,8,-1, 2,7,8,1,0,0,0,0,0}
`
